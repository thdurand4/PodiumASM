How to create a workflow
========================

PodiumASM allows you to build a workflow using a simple ``config.yaml`` configuration file :

* First, provide the data paths
* Second, activate the requested tools for assembly and correction.
* Third, activate the tools for quality checking of assemblies.
* And last, manage the tools parameters.

To create this file, just run:


.. click:: podiumASM.main:create_config
    :prog: podiumASM create_config
    :show-nested:

Then, edit the relevant sections of the file to customize your flavor of a workflow.


1. Providing data
------------------

First, indicate the data path in the ``config.yaml`` configuration file:

.. code-block:: YAML

   DATA:
       FASTQ: '/path/to/fastq/directory/'
       REF: '/path/to/referencefile.fasta'
       GENOME_SIZE: '1m'
       FAST5: '/path/to/fast5/directory/'
       ILLUMINA: '/path/to/illumina/directory/'
       OUTPUT: '/path/to/output/directory/'

Find here a summary table with the description of each data needed to run PodiumASM :

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Input", "Description"
    :widths: auto

    "FASTQ", "Every FASTQ file should contain the whole set of reads to be assembled per individual. Each fastq file will be assembled independently."
    "REF","Only one REFERENCE genome file will be used in each PodiumASM run. This REFERENCE will be used for various quality steps (i.e. ASSEMBLYTICS, QUAST and MAUVE)"
    "GENOME_SIZE", "Estimated genome size of the assembly can be provided in mega (Mb), giga(Gb) or kilobases (Kb). This size is used by some assemblers (e.g. CANU) and also by the QUAST quality step"
    "FAST5","Nanopolish uses FAST5 files to polish, and Medaka needs FAST5 files if a model training step is requested. Please give the path of the FAST5 folder in the *FAST5* DATA parameter. Inside this directory, a subdirectory with the exact same name as the corresponding FASTQ (before the *.fastq.gz*\ ) is required. For instance, if in the *FASTQ* directory we have *run1.fastq.gz* and *run2.fastq.gz*\ , PodiumASM is expecting the *run1/* and *run2/* subdirectories in the FAST5 main directory"
    "ILLUMINA","Indicates the path to the directory with *Illumina* sequence data (in fastq or fastq.gz format), to perform pilon correction, KAT QC or MERQURY QC. Use preferentially paired-end data. All fastq files need to be homogeneous in their extension name. Please use *run1_R1* and *run1_R2* nomenclature."
    "OUTPUT","output *path* directory"

.. warning::

    For FASTQ, the naming conventions accepted by PodiumASM are either *NAME.fastq.gz* or *NAME.fq.gz* or *NAME.fastq* or *NAME.fq*. Use preferentially short names and avoid special characters to avoid report failure. Please do not use the long name provided directly by the sequencing machine.

    All fastq files have to be homogeneous on their extension, and can be compressed or not.

    Reference fasta file needs a fasta or fa extension, uncompressed.


2. Choose assemblers, polisher and correctors
---------------------------------------------

Activate/deactivate assemblers, polishers and correctors as you wish, usin TRUE/FALSE boolean operators.
Feel free to activate only assembly, assembly+polishing or assembly+polishing+correction.

.. note::
    If you expect your genome to include a circular replicon (e.g. with prokaryote), it is recommended to activate CIRCULAR steps

Example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../podiumASM/install_files/config.yaml
    :language: YAML
    :lines: 10-27


3. Choose quality control tools
--------------------------------

PodiumASM can use several quality control tools to check assemblies.

* If BUSCO or QUAST are used, they will run on every fasta assembly generated along the various steps of the pipeline.

* If BLOBTOOLS, ASSEMBLYTICS, FLAGSTATS, MERQURY and KAT are activated, only the fasta assembly generated after the last sequence processing step of the pipeline will be checked.

* KAT and MERQURY quality tools can be activated but Illumina reads are mandatory in this case. These reads can be compressed or not.

.. literalinclude:: ../../podiumASM/install_files/config.yaml
    :language: YAML
    :lines: 29-38

If several assemblers are activated, a multiple alignment of the various assemblies **for small genomes (<10-20Mbp)** can be computed with Mauve.

* If you want to improve alignment with MAUVE on circular molecules, it is recommended to activate the *Fixstart* step.
* Only activate MAUVE if you have more than one assembler per sample, more than one quality step and small genomes.

.. literalinclude:: ../../podiumASM/install_files/config.yaml
    :language: YAML
    :lines: 41-43


4. Parameters for some specific tools
--------------------------------------

You can manage tools parameters on the params section in the ``config.yaml`` file.

`Racon`` specific options:

* Racon can be launched recursively from 1 to 9 rounds.

``Medaka`` specific options:

* If 'MEDAKA_TRAIN_WITH_REF' is activated, Medaka launchs the training using the reference found in 'DATA/REF' path parameter. Medaka will then not take into account other Medaka model parameters and will use the resulting trained model instead.

* If 'MEDAKA_TRAIN_WITH_REF' is deactivated, Medaka does not launch training, but uses instead the model provided in 'MEDAKA_MODEL_PATH' parameter. Give to PodiumASM the path of the Medaka model *OR* just the model name in order to correct assemblies. This parameter could not be empty.

.. important::
    Medaka models can be downloaded from the Medaka repository. You need to install ``git lfs`` (see documentation here https://git-lfs.github.com/) to download largest files before ``git clone https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka.git\``.

``Pilon`` specific options:

* We fixed the java memory parameter in the Singularity.culebront_tools to 8G. If you need to allocate more memory, change this value using ``sed -i "s/-Xmx1g/-Xmx8g/g" /usr/local/miniconda/miniconda3/envs/pilon/bin/pilon`` in the ``Containers/Singularity.culebront_tools.def`` recipe file before building the Singularity image.

``Busco`` specific options:

* If BUSCO is activated, you must provide to PodiumASM the path of a Busco database *OR* only the database name (See the `Busco documentation <https://busco.ezlab.org/busco_userguide.html#genome-mode-assessing-a-genome-assembly>`_).This parameter cannot be empty.

``Blobtools`` specific options:
* Nodes and names from the NCBI taxdump database can be download here : https://github.com/DRL/blobtools#download-ncbi-taxdump-and-create-nodesdb

The standard parameters used in PodiumASM are shown below. Feel free to adapt it to your own requirements.

.. literalinclude:: ../../podiumASM/install_files/config.yaml
    :language: YAML
    :lines: 46-

.. warning::
    Please check documentation of each tool (outside of PodiumASM, and make sure that the settings are correct!)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to run the workflow
=======================

Before attempting to run PodiumASM, please verify that you have already modified the ``config.yaml`` file as explained in :ref:`1. Providing data`.

If you installed PodiumASM on a HPC cluster with a job scheduler, you can run:


.. click:: podiumASM.main:run_cluster
    :prog: podiumASM run_cluster
    :show-nested:


------------------------------------------------------------------------


.. click:: podiumASM.main:run_local
    :prog: podiumASM run_local
    :show-nested:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advance run
===========

Providing more resources
--------------------------

If the cluster default resources are not sufficient, you can edit the ``cluster_config.yaml`` file. See :ref:`2. Adapting *cluster_config.yaml*`:

.. click:: podiumASM.main:edit_cluster_config
    :prog: podiumASM edit_cluster_config
    :show-nested:


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Providing your own tools_config.yaml
-------------------------------------

To change the tools used in a PodiumASM workflow, you can see :ref:`3. How to configure tools_path.yaml`

.. click:: podiumASM.main:edit_tools
    :prog: podiumASM edit_tools
    :show-nested:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Report
======

PodiumASM generates a useful HTML report, including the versions of tools used and, for each fastq, a summary of statistics. Please have a look at |location_link| ... and enjoy !!

.. note::

    Because of constraints imposed by Snakemake, we cannot include the version of bwa and seqtk in the report https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/advanced.html#step-5-loggin. If you want to know the versions of these tools, go check by yourself ^^.

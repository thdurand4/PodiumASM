Long-read sequencing is a highly accurate approach that can be used to
challenging genomes, such as those containing stretches of highly 
repetitive elements and lot of structural variant. Long read can also sequencing
be used to generate de novo assembly and genome finishing applications

Lot of tools are used to make genome assembly with long reads every day
and you sometimes you don't know wich Assembler tool is the best for
your organism. 

**PodiumASM is here for you !** PodiumASM is is an open-source, scalable, modulable and traceable snakemake pipeline, able to compare multiple long read assemblies obtained from multiple assemblers tools. The workflow PodiumASM can help you to choose the best assemblies among all possibilities.
